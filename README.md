Report-Clustering

This is a interesting question to cluter the different reports by the features. 
However, like any real data, they are not clean (missing, duplicates and so on),
and features are not logically independent.

Data munging is important and challenging. Please read the python and make the changes
freely.

Happy collabrative programming!
